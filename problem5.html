<h4>solution:</h4>
<h4>a:Integrated Pest Management(IPM): </h4><p>Adopting IPM practices involves a combination of biological,cultural,physical,and chemical control measures to manage pests effectively while minimizing the use of pesticides.IPM emphasizes monitoring,early detection,and the use of alternative control methods.</p>
<h4>b:Selective and Targeted Pesticide Use:</h4><p> Using pesticides judiciously and selectively, only when necessary,based on pest thresholds and monitoring, helps reduce unnecessary chemical applications.Targeting specific pests with more environmentally friendly pesticides can minimize the impact on non-target organisms.</p>
<h4>c:Organic and Natural Fertilizers:</h4><p>Using organic fertilizers like compost, manure, green manure, or biofertilizers helps improve soil fertility and structure while minimizing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers. These organic inputs release nutrients slowly, promoting sustainable soil health.</p>
