<h4>solution:</h4>
<p>Climate change poses significant challenges for paddy cultivation due to its impact on temperature, rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events.Farmers can employ several strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change while cultivating paddy:</p>
<h4>a:Diversification of Varieties:</h4><p> Planting diverse rice varieties that are more resilient to changing climatic conditions, such as drought-tolerant or flood-resistant varieties, can help farmers adapt to varying environmental stresses.</p>
<h4>b:Conservation Agriculture: </h4><p>Practices like zero tillage, minimum tillage, and conservation tillage help in retaining soil moisture, improving soil structure, and minimizing soil erosion. These methods contribute to climate resilience by preserving soil health.</p>
<h4>c:Crop Calendar Adjustment:</h4><p> Adjusting the cropping calendar according to changing climate patterns,such as altering planting dates or choosing varieties with different maturation periods, can help mitigate the risks associated with extreme weather events.</p>
